# AI & ML & DL Concepts

So we've learned about quite concrete AWS services, but in this section we're going to take a step back and learn about AI and machine learning overall.

This section is a little bit more theory-oriented and it has a lot of information. Don't worry and don't go too much into the details.

What I want you to **understand**, is the general idea behind AI, machine learning, deep learning, and generative AI.

If you've understood this, then you will be acing your questions at the exam.

I hope you will really understand the behind those scenes of AI and machine learning.
