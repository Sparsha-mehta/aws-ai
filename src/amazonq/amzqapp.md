# Amazon Q Apps

Now let's talk about Amazon Q Apps. Q Apps are part of Q Business, and the idea is that you can create Gen AI-powered apps without coding by only using natural language.

## **Amazon Q Apps Creator**

We have a web UI called Amazon Q Apps Creator. In this interface, you can specify a prompt to describe the type of app you want to have. Again, this app is going to be based on your company data.

## **How It Works**

You're going to say, "Hey, I want to do this kind of app," and automatically, Amazon Q App is going to generate for you a web application where we can:

- Upload a document
- Upload prompts  
- Enable users to interact with the app

## **Key Benefits**

This really makes it super easy for anyone in your company to create an app based on:

1. Your company's internal data
2. Leveraging plugins

The core concept is that anyone can create a very quick app without using developers, and that's the idea behind Amazon Q Apps.
