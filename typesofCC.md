# Types of Cloud Computing
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
  - There are the building blocks for Cloud IT
  - With the IaaS, we are going to provide networking, computers, and data storage space in its raw form
  - Using this building blocks (like Legos), we will get High Level of Flexibility
  - With this, we can easily migrate from Traditional on Premises-IT to Cloud
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
  - In this, we are going to remove the need for your organization to manage the underlying infrastructure &
  - You can focus on the deployment and management of your applications
- Software as a Service (SaaS)
  - This is a completed product that is going to be run and managed by the Service Provider

#### So if you want to compare all of these things:
Let us take an example -> **On premises** you are going to manage everything. This will involved your:
1. Applications
2. Data
3. Runtime 
4. Middleware
5. the OS (Operating System)
6. Virtualization
7. Servers 
8. Storage
9. Networking

With the **IaaS** (Infrastructure as a Service), we are going to manage the:
1. Application
2. Data
3. Runtime
4. Middleware &
5. OS

But all of the:
6. Virtualization
7. Servers
8. Storage &
9. Networking<br>
are going to be managed by others (In our case AWS)

With the **PaaS** (Platform as a Service), we manage even less, so everything from the runtime to the networking is managed by AWS and the only thing we care about when we use a platform as a service is our application and our data, meaning:
1. Application (we will manage this)
2. Data (we will manage this)
3. Runtime (AWS will handle it)
4. Middleware (AWS will handle it)
5. OS (AWS will handle it)
6. Virtualization (AWS will handle it)
7. Servers (AWS will handle it)
8. Storage (AWS will handle it)
9. Networking (AWS will handle it)
